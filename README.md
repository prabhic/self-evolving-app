WIP
I feel, AI based IDE's, fitting tradition AI into traditional IDE's.
Didn't feel right after debugging the code that AI generated, as it keeps loosing context, at multiple levels and something is missing. and we are not using AI's full potential.
Felt like more natural evolution is self evoling app, with ai at its core.

# **Self-Evolving App**

The **Self-Evolving App** is an LLM-driven application generator designed to evolve itself over time. Starting as a single-file generator, it builds its own multi-file application structure, adapts to user inputs, and continuously expands its capabilities autonomously. This project represents the next step in autonomous software development.

---

## **Features**
- **Recursive Code Generation**: Automatically generates its own files, directories, and configurations.
- **Self-Debugging**: Detects issues, suggests fixes, and optimizes its codebase without external intervention.
- **User-Guided Evolution**: Engages users with questions to refine and expand the application’s functionality.
- **Self-Monitoring**: Tracks logs, internal states, and performance metrics in real-time.
- **Autonomous Deployment**: Deploys itself seamlessly and manages its runtime environment.

---

## **How It Works**
1. **Initialization**: Start with a single-file generator (`self_evolving_app.py`).
2. **Feature Definition**: The app asks the user for initial features and generates a basic application structure.
3. **Self-Growth**: Iteratively generates and evolves its own codebase based on user feedback.
4. **Deployment**: Prepares and deploys itself to a local or cloud environment.
5. **Monitoring and Optimization**: Tracks its performance and adapts based on runtime metrics and logs.

---

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-evolving-app.git
   cd self-evolving-app
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python self_evolving_app.py
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. Run the script and follow the prompts to define your project name and initial features.
2. Review the generated app files in the project directory.
3. Add new features iteratively as prompted by the app.
4. Deploy the app or continue its evolution.

---

## **Roadmap**
- [ ] Add support for multiple programming languages.
- [ ] Enable automatic containerization (e.g., Docker).
- [ ] Introduce CI/CD pipeline integration.
- [ ] Add runtime performance monitoring and optimization.
- [ ] Enable full-stack application generation (frontend + backend).
