##Self-Evolving App
The Self-Evolving App is an LLM-driven application generator that evolves itself over time. Starting as a single-file generator, it builds its own multi-file application structure, adapts to user inputs, and continuously expands its capabilities without external dependencies. This project represents the next step in autonomous software development, where the application:

Generates Itself: Creates its own code, configurations, and files based on user-defined features.
Evolves Continuously: Asks questions, adapts to feedback, and refines its functionality over iterations.
Debugs and Optimizes: Self-monitors logs, variable states, and LLM responses to ensure efficiency and correctness.
Deploys Autonomously: Prepares itself for deployment and manages its runtime environment.
Learns and Adapts: Uses feedback loops to propose new features and improve performance.
Why Self-Evolving?
Traditional development workflows rely on IDEs and human effort for iteration and debugging. The Self-Evolving App eliminates these bottlenecks by embedding LLM intelligence directly into the lifecycle, making it self-sufficient and always in sync with user intent.

Core Features
Recursive Code Generation: Generates its own files and evolves its architecture as it grows.
Self-Debugging: Identifies issues, suggests fixes, and optimizes its own codebase.
User-Guided Evolution: Engages the user for input and direction, ensuring alignment with goals.
Self-Monitoring: Tracks internal states, logs, and performance metrics in real-time.
Fully Autonomous Deployment: From code generation to running applications in production.
Vision
To create a framework where apps can grow, evolve, and manage themselves, enabling faster innovation and lowering the barrier to application development.
